[{"categories":["Design"],"contents":"There are many decisions to make when building a new construction home, before and after you move in. I wanted to share some less common considerations and related upgrades that we made while designing, building and getting settled in our new home. Enjoy!\n1. Future-Proof Cabinets There are some cabinet materials that can’t or shouldn’t be painted, like vinyl, laminate, and engineered wood for example. If your preferred cabinet color requires an undesirable upgrade and you plan to ‘get the look’ with paint instead, be sure to choose a compatible material when selecting your cabinets from the design center.\n2. Goodbye Formal Dining - Hello Home Office + Extra Bedroom If you know you\u0026rsquo;re not the formal dinging room type, consider converting it into a space that you\u0026rsquo;ll actually use\u0026hellip;like a home office. That\u0026rsquo;s exactly what we did when we reviewed the design plans with our builder. This involved a few changes to the plans\u0026hellip;like adding some double doors, opting for a ceiling fan instead of a chandelier, some additional outlets for two desks and a ‘high-low’ for mounting our Samsung Frame TV between the two desks.\nAs you may know, if you add a closet to a room with windows….PRESTO, you officially have an extra bedroom. That\u0026rsquo;s exactly what we did to the room that was originally supposed to be the home office (according to the design plans).\nAdding a closet to the originally planned office cost us about $2,000. Considering that an additional bedroom adds about 4-6% to the value of our home, it was a smart and super easy decision to do this relatively low cost upgrade.\n3. Drop-in vs Freestanding Bathtub Our owner’s en suite included a standard drop-in tub, which is when the tub is surrounded and enclosed in tile, usually in a corner of the bathroom. We upgraded to the builder’s single (and likey overpriced) option for a freestanding bathtub.\nOverall I\u0026rsquo;m happy with this decision, but I realize now that we could have considered a different route. They might have agreed to skip the buildout altogether and just do the plumbing work so that the tub of our choice could be installed after closing on the house. This would have broadened our design choices and probably saved us a few thousand bucks.\n4. Shower Niche Placement We wanted to keep soaps, shampoos and other shower products out of sight, so we asked for the niche to be built in a way that is not visible unless you’re actually taking a shower. I’m so happy we did this - it gives us a clean and tidy look from the outside, even though that’s usually not the case on the inside.\n5. Custom Closet Prep We planned on building \u0026lsquo;custom\u0026rsquo; (Ikea Pax) closets in our owner\u0026rsquo;s suite immediately after moving in. We asked the builder not to finish out that closet with clothing racks so that we didn’t have to remove them before we could install the custom stuff.\n6. Water/Toilet Closet \u0026ldquo;Upgrade\u0026rdquo; We asked for an uncommon (and very inexpensive) upgrade - adding an electrical outlet to the ‘water closet’ in the owner’s suite bathroom, so that we could plug in a night-light. Now we don’t have to turn on the light for those middle-of-the-night trips to the bathroom!\n7. (Media) Room with a View Our builder provided the option to upgrade to a traditional media room, which is essentially a room with no windows. Instead, we chose to add their ‘bonus room’ option. It\u0026rsquo;s in the same location, but has four windows along the back wall. We still set it up as a media room.\nWhen the room isn’t being used for movie-watching, we can leave the doors open to enjoy the second-story view and natural light in the room. When it’s time to watch a show, our floor-to-ceiling blackout curtains do the trick. This gives us more of a multi-purpose or \u0026lsquo;flex\u0026rsquo; room, which is also a nice differentiator for furutre re-sale.\n8. Pre-treated Grout We paid a very small amount to upgrade to pre-treated grout, which is more resistant to stains, mold and mildew. I paid way more to have the grout professionally sealed in our previous home\u0026hellip;they did a terrible job, and I ended up going back over what they did by hand. I was very happy to skip this step and still get the extra protection.\n9. Carpet Pad Regrets This is another fairly inexpensive upgrade, and one that we actually forgot to do. Our upstairs is carpeted and the standard pad they used is pretty thin. When we\u0026rsquo;re walking around, we notice and regret it\u0026hellip;especially since we went through the trouble of upgrading the carpet itself. Lesson learned.\n10. White Ceilings are an Upgrade I was surprised to learn that it is standard for most new home builders to paint the ceilings the same color you choose for your walls. Unless you pick white for your walls, this could become a major design issue for you. This one might be a little more common knowledge, but I wanted to mention it anyway because it\u0026rsquo;s definately something you don\u0026rsquo;t want to realize after-the-fact.\nEven though our wall color is very light gray, we still opted to upgrade to white ceilings to keep things light and bright\u0026hellip;and in case we ever want to go with a darker wall color in the future. You can also skip the upgrade cost by choosing \u0026lsquo;builder\u0026rsquo;s white\u0026rsquo; paint everywhere, and then paint the walls in a different color room-by-room over time.\n","permalink":"https://dreacole.com/blog/newbuild-considerations/","tags":["New Construction"],"title":"10 Uncommon Things to Consider for New Construction Homes"},{"categories":["Design"],"contents":"Creating a stay-cation worthy backyard oasis for my family has been my latest obsession.\nTony and I started building our new home shortly after getting engaged in February 2019. We tied the knot with a small wedding in May and by December that same year, we had moved in (which took us 2 days until 4am, but that\u0026rsquo;s another story). It was a magical but hectic period of time to say the least.\nAnd we all know what happens next\u0026hellip;yep, COVID-19.\nWith all the craziness and heart-breaking news, we were extra grateful to already be in our new home during quarantine. The social and travel limitations brought on by the novel coronavirus made me want to create an outdoor space where we could de-stress and have our own little \u0026lsquo;vacation spot\u0026rsquo; even though we had to stay home.\nWe live in Texas and the summers are brutal, so we had already planned on building a pool. I was a little nervous about following through with it because of all of the uncertainty at the time, but we had already budgeted for it. After some convincing from Tony, we decided to go ahead and I\u0026rsquo;m so glad we did.\nDesigning the pool-to-yard ratio was a little tricky since our backyard isn\u0026rsquo;t that big, but eventually came to agreement on a design that gave us a nice-sized swimming area and two corners of yard space for the kids to play in.\nWe broke ground in May 2020 and it took about 3 months to complete.\nAlso, my oldest son graduated high school (COVID-style) in May with plans to move out shortly after. He swears that we purposely planned it to where the pool would be finished after he moved out so that he couldn\u0026rsquo;t use it unless he came back to visit. This wasn\u0026rsquo;t true, but we co-signed on his theory just to mess with him.\nBefore we designed the pool we had taken a trip to Hollywood, Florida for our honeymoon. We stayed at The Diplomat Beach Resort, which I highly recommend by the way. It\u0026rsquo;s a beautiful resort with some great restaurants\u0026hellip;especially Monkitail.\nAnyway, we planned a day by the pool and rented one of their cabanas (designed by Trina Turk!). We had an amazing day lounging, looking up the ocean, listening to the wind through the palm trees and sipping on delicious cocktails.\nThat trip became my inspiration for creating our own backyard vacation oasis\u0026hellip;and I really wanted to incorporate a \u0026lsquo;cabana\u0026rsquo; too. For the furniture, I looked for modular seating because it can be configured different ways to work for both big and small groups. I can\u0026rsquo;t wait until we\u0026rsquo;re able to have our first official pool party!\nAfter many months of research, I decided that the Sunjoy Bridgeport hardtop gazebo was the best choice for our cabana. The black metal roof was the same as what we have on some parts of our house and the natural wood tone was a nice way to break up the modern design and gray tones of the pool. It took the two of us 16 hours over the weekend to assemble it, and I\u0026rsquo;m very happy with the end result!\nI\u0026rsquo;ll definately be sharing updates as we make more progress on our backyard vacation oasis, but in the mean time, I hope you enjoy my backsyard oasis inspiration board.\nShop this post (from left to right)\nGazebo / Cabana | Black Pillow | Striped pillow | Natural pillow | Outdoor chandelier | Unbreakable plates/bowls | Unbreakable wine glasses | Modular Sunbrella sectional - in Cast Silver | Solar string lights | Modern fire table | Waterproof curtain panels - in white | Faux ivy privacy screen | Egg chair - in Linen | Black/white lumbar pillow | Wicker stacking chairs - in grey/white | Outdoor umbrella - in black/white | Round dining table | 14 inch solar lantern | 18 inch solar lantern | White bird of paradise plant\nCheck out my other inspiration boards here.\n","permalink":"https://dreacole.com/blog/backyard-oasis-inspiration/","tags":["Outdoor","Backyard","Backyard Vacation","Inspiration Board"],"title":"Backyard Oasis - Inspiration Board"},{"categories":["entertaining"],"contents":"You may have seen them on social media\u0026hellip;\nGorgeous photos of travelers enjoying a ‘floating brunch’ at a luxury resort in Bali or Thailand. This was on my mind as I looked at the newly completed pool in our backyard.\nI thought it would be fun to try to re-create a similar experience at home. With no plans for a trip to either of those beautiful destinations, a private \u0026lsquo;stay-cation\u0026rsquo; style floating brunch still sounded pretty great!\nThe Floating Tray The floating trays from Wahoo Living seem to look the most similar to what I\u0026rsquo;ve seen on social media, but I wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to purchase one directly from their website.\nI found the one I was looking for (from Wahoo Living) on Amazon.\nThey offered two colors at the time, white and brown. I initially intended to buy the white one, but it was out of stock and I was impatient\u0026hellip;so I just ordered the brown. I actually like it a lot and I\u0026rsquo;m glad I ended up with this color.\nThe DIY Floating Brunch My husband’s face looked both excited and horrified when I told him we were about to have brunch in our pool. His mind was racing with images of a flipped tray, broken dishes and food on the bottom of our brand new pool.\nThankfully, everything was very stable on the tray as it floated in the water.\nEven so, I was glad I used our lightweight break-resistant melamine plates and bowls for the food and unbreakable stemless wine glasses for our mimosas (and for when I have wine while relaxing in the bathtub, which I highly recommend).\nI love the classic look of white dishware and clear glass, so I was thrilled that I can achieve this look outdoors with no worries. The only exception is our coffee cups and saucers - I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find an unbreakable equivalent that I liked, so those are the real deal, and we were just real careful.\nThe DIY floating brunch was a (totally unnecessary but) really fun, romantic and memorable experience. The best part is that now we can enjoy it as often as we’d like!\nI think this tray is a \u0026lsquo;must-have\u0026rsquo; if you have a pool for obvious reasons, but even if you don\u0026rsquo;t, I actually think it\u0026rsquo;s a great overall investment for entertaining. You can line it and load it up with ice for a spacious and stylish cooler, lay down some parchment paper and serve charcuterie, or even breakfast in bed!\nFloating or not, I\u0026rsquo;m really happy with my DIY floating brunch and the many ways I can use this versital, well-made tray in the future!\nShop this post:           ","permalink":"https://dreacole.com/blog/floating-tray-brunch/","tags":["brunch","pool","Outdoor"],"title":"Bali-inspired DIY Floating Brunch"},{"categories":["Design"],"contents":"I’ve never had much luck with plants\u0026hellip;\nBut our house has tons of natural light and a courtyard - yaasss! - so I was inspired to fill both with live plants and become the plant mom I’ve secretly always wanted to be.\nI tend to fully commit to things like this, but I still surprised myself (and my husband) when I bought something like 25 plants in 2 weeks. I started to notice what an impact they make and it was hard to stop.\nReal or fake, plants add visual interest, softness and color\u0026hellip;which works especially well in spaces with more of a modern aesthetic and neutral colors, like ours.\nSee for yourself in some before and after pics (where I only added plants)\u0026hellip;\nI buy my plants from various places\u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;Etsy, the garden department at Lowe’s and Home Depot, Plantvine, Bloomscape and even Amazon.\nBloomscape is a great option for when you want full sized plants that are ready for display upon arrival.

My husband cannot control himself around this guacamole and typically eats so much that he ends up (accidentally) making it a meal.\nI like to put a good amount of garlic and spice in almost everything I make; this recipe is no different. If that isn’t your thing, skip it altogether or just add less than what the recipe calls for.\nIngredients  5 large ripe avocados 2 or 3 green onions, diced ¼ cup red onions, diced (optional) 3 cloves garlic, minced ½ lime, juiced 2 serrano peppers (minced, one with seeds \u0026amp; one without) 1 large ripe tomato, diced (or) about 15 cherry tomatoes, quartered Small bunch of cilantro, chopped 1 tsp ground cumin ½ tsp garlic powder ½ - 1 tsp kosher salt (to taste) 1 tsp fresh ground black pepper  Preparation Um\u0026hellip;put all that %#@! in a bowl and stir it. ;) Just kidding….but not that much.\n Cut four of the avocados in half, discard the pits, scoop out the green goodness, chop into small pieces and put into a large bowl. Leave the fifth one alone for now; see tips. Add all other ingredients into the same bowl, and mix until well combined. Taste and adjust seasoning if needed. Let it sit for about 5 mins, then give it another good stir. Grab a spoon or some of your favorite tortilla chips and show that guac who the real boss is!  Tips  If you prefer a smoother texture - smash some or all of the avocado with a fork instead of chopping it. I personally like this with a little of both red and green onions. If you prefer, skip the green onion and sub ½ cup of diced red or white onion instead. The actual size of the avocados you use can affect how much salt, spice, lime, etc. is actually needed. If you’re unsure, start with half of the spice, salt, and lime quantities, then taste and add more if needed. If you happen to over-season, just add the 5th avocado. Give it a little sweetness by mixing in some fresh diced pineapple or mango instead of (or in addition to) the tomato. Spread on toast and top with a fried egg and/or some bacon; so delicious!

Their Orlando platform bed had a very similar modern look with custom fabric choices and headboards up to 120”\u0026hellip;and the price was thousands less than the RH bed.\nThey had great reviews, so I decided to take a chance.\nCustomizing the Orlando bed was fun and easy.

I ordered my first one at a Brazilian steakhouse and it instantly became my new favorite cocktail!\nIt’s already a very easy to make at home with only three ingredients - limes, sugar and Brazilian cachaça rum (made from fermented sugarcane juice)\u0026hellip;it\u0026rsquo;s so refreshing and so good.\nThe other day, I wanted to make a Caipirinha but we didn\u0026rsquo;t have any limes!

Cachaça rum is available at most liquor stores. I recommend starting with Pirassununga 51 Cachaça if you don’t already have a favorite brand. When we enjoy these outside (especially if we\u0026rsquo;re by the pool), I switch to using our unbreakable rocks glasses or unbreakable stemless wine glasses (with a little less ice).

Also, the delivery guy stacked all 11 boxes in front of our garage door, so we were blocked in anyway!\n(By the way, I love these couches so much - post coming soon).\nLong story short, we stayed home and enjoyed a homemade brunch with Bellinis on the new comfy couches in our backyard.\nA traditional Bellini is made with fresh or frozen peach puree. We didn’t have any peaches, but we did have a bottle of Simply Peach juice - hello shortcut!\nReasons Why You Will Love This Easy Bellini Recipe  Takes about 5 minutes to make an entire batch You can make this bellini recipe in advance! Mix the juice + vodka ahead of time, then add chilled chamgpage just before you\u0026rsquo;re ready to serve. Easy to customize A nice alternative to mimosas Can be made with or without vodka Enjoy bellinis even if/when you don\u0026rsquo;t have peach puree Quick and delicious The perfect brunch cocktail  Some notes  I made this batch in a 1 liter juice carafe like this one. I used regular vodka this time, but you can make it with a peach-flavored or even vanilla-flavored vodka instead! I personally have tried it with the vanilla vodka and it was really tasty. This drink is best served chilled, so make sure your champagne or sparkling wine and Simply Peach juice are nice and cold from the start. Bonus if you store your vodka in the freezer, but you can also chill the vodka with ice and strain it if not. The keep the carafe in the refridgerator or on ice in between servings. Traditional bellinis are made with Prosecco, but I prefer a Brut champagne or dry sparkling wine - the peach juice adds a good amount of sweetness. Use whichever you like best! After you pour bellini, you can always add more juice to your glass if you like it sweeter. If you don’t have or like vodka, no worries! It’s still pretty great with just the bubbles and peach juice. Some of my go-to choices when making cocktails are Tott\u0026rsquo;s Brut Champagne (pictured), Alma Brut, and Veuve de Vernay. These are also pretty good for drinking on their own\u0026hellip;although for that my personal favorite is Veuve Clicquot Brut.

In our previous home, it turned into a nice-to-look-at fully furnished room that ended up as an expensive drop-off zone for random stuff as we went in and out of the house.\nWhen we entertained, everyone would naturally gravitate to the living room, kitchen island and the kitchen table. Actually now that I think about it, I’ve never even eaten in a friend’s formal dining room, because they don’t use them either!\nSo\u0026hellip;a formal dining in the new house? Nope, let’s skip that.\nInstead, we decided to use the formal dining room as our home office. This involved a few changes to the plans\u0026hellip;like adding some double doors, opting for a ceiling fan instead of a chandelier, some additional outlets for two desks and a ‘high-low’ for mounting our Samsung Frame TV in between the desks.\nCan we just talk about the black office doors for a hot second? I love how they instantly elevate the space. I mean, just yes!\nOkay so at this point in the house design plans, we have two offices\u0026hellip;the converted dining room and the originally designated office. As you may know, if you add a closet to a room with windows….PRESTO, you officially have an extra bedroom.\nAnd that’s just what we did.\nAdding a closet to the originally planned office cost us about $2,000. Considering that an additional bedroom adds about 4-6% to the value of our home, it was a smart and super easy decision to do this relatively low cost upgrade.\nBy the way, converting a formal dining room into an office is just one of the ten less-common home building tips that I talk about in another other post; you can check it out here.\nIn the end, we got the office we needed, an additional bedroom + increased home value, and we avoided the cost of furnishing a formal dining room that we would probably never use.\nShop this post (from left to right)\nGlass Floor Lamp | Printable Art - Set of 3 | Modern Wall Clock | Modern Cognac Sofa | Black Throw Pillows | Glass Table Lamp | Black Side Table | Faux Fiddle Fig Plant | Black Scented Candle | Distressed Area Rug | Samsung Frame TV | Black Adjustable Standing Desk | Gray Office Chair | Slim Filing Cabinet\nCheck out my other inspiration boards here.\n","permalink":"https://dreacole.com/blog/work-from-home-office-inspo/","tags":["Work From Home","Inspiration Board"],"title":"Work From Home Office Inspiration Board"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Your subscription to our list has been confirmed.\nThank you for subscribing!\n","permalink":"https://dreacole.com/contact/confirmed/","tags":null,"title":"Subscription Confirmed"}]
