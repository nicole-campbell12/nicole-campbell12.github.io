[{"categories":["Design"],"contents":"There are many decisions to make when building a new construction home, before and after you move in. I wanted to share some less common considerations and related upgrades that we made while designing, building and getting settled in our new home.\n1. Future-Proof Cabinets There are some cabinet materials that can’t or shouldn’t be painted, like vinyl, laminate, and engineered wood for example. If your preferred cabinet color requires an undesirable upgrade and you plan to ‘get the look’ with paint instead, be sure to choose a compatible material when selecting your cabinets from the design center.\n2. Natural Lighting Changes Our owner’s bedroom and attached bathroom gets tons of natural light from the windows facing the empty lot next door. Initially I thought our bathroom was so bright that it could handle some dark and moody shades, but then I realized how much light we’ll probably lose once that lot has a two-story house it.\nI decided to keep our temporary blinds up until I can really see how our view, privacy and lighting will be affected once the construction next door is completed.\n3. Drop-in vs Freestanding Bathtub Our owner’s en suite included a standard drop-in tub, which is when the tub is surrounded and enclosed in tile, usually in a corner of the bathroom. We upgraded to the builder’s single (and likey overpriced) option for a freestanding bathtub.\nOverall I\u0026rsquo;m happy with this decision, but I realize now that we could have considered a different route. They might have agreed to skip the buildout altogether and just do the plumbing work so that the tub of our choice could be installed after closing on the house. This would have broadened our design choices and probably saved us a few thousand bucks.\n4. Shower Niche Placement We wanted to keep soaps, shampoos and other shower products out of sight, so we asked for the niche to be built in a way that is not visible unless you’re actually taking a shower. I’m so happy we did this - it gives us a clean and tidy look from the outside, even though that’s usually not the case on the inside.\n5. Custom Closet Prep We planned on building \u0026lsquo;custom\u0026rsquo; (Ikea Pax) closets in our owner\u0026rsquo;s suite immediately after moving in. We asked the builder not to finish out that closet with clothing racks so that we didn’t have to remove them before we could install the custom stuff.\n6. Water/Toilet Closet \u0026ldquo;Upgrade\u0026rdquo; We asked for an uncommon (and very inexpensive) upgrade - adding an electrical outlet to the ‘water closet’ in the owner’s suite bathroom, so that we could plug in a night-light. Now we don’t have to turn on the light for those middle-of-the-night trips to the bathroom!\n7. (Media) Room with a View Our builder provided the option to upgrade to a traditional media room, which is essentially a room with no windows. Instead, we chose to add their ‘bonus room’ option. It\u0026rsquo;s in the same location, but has four windows along the back wall. We still set it up as a media room.\nWhen the room isn’t being used for movie-watching, we can leave the doors open to enjoy the second-story view and natural light in the room. When it’s time to watch a show, our floor-to-ceiling blackout curtains do the trick. This gives us more of a multi-purpose or \u0026lsquo;flex\u0026rsquo; room, which is also a nice differentiator for furutre re-sale.\n8. Pre-treated Grout We paid a very small amount to upgrade to pre-treated grout, which is more resistant to stains, mold and mildew. I paid way more to have the grout professionally sealed in our previous home\u0026hellip;they did a terrible job, and I ended up going back over what they did by hand. I was very happy to skip this step and still get the extra protection.\n9. Carpet Pad Regrets This is another fairly inexpensive upgrade, and one that we actually forgot to do. Our upstairs is carpeted and the standard pad they used is pretty thin. When we\u0026rsquo;re walking around, we notice and regret it\u0026hellip;especially since we went through the trouble of upgrading the carpet itself. Lesson learned.\n10. White Ceilings are an Upgrade I was surprised to learn that it is standard for most new home builders to paint the ceilings the same color you choose for your walls. Unless you pick white for your walls, this could become a major design issue for you. This one might be a little more common knowledge, but I wanted to mention it anyway because it\u0026rsquo;s definately something you don\u0026rsquo;t want to realize after-the-fact.\nEven though our wall color is very light gray, we still opted to upgrade to white ceilings to keep things light and bright\u0026hellip;and in case we ever want to go with a darker wall color in the future. You can also skip the upgrade cost by choosing \u0026lsquo;builder\u0026rsquo;s white\u0026rsquo; paint everywhere, and then paint the walls in a different color room-by-room over time.\n","permalink":"https://dreacole.com/blog/newbuild-considerations/","tags":["New Construction"],"title":"10 Uncommon Things to Consider for New Construction Homes"},{"categories":["Design"],"contents":"We\u0026rsquo;ve been making good progress in our backyard so far.

This was on my mind as I looked at the newly completed pool in our backyard.\nI thought it would be fun to try to re-create a similar experience at home. With no plans for a trip to either of those beautiful destinations, a private \u0026lsquo;stay-cation\u0026rsquo; style floating brunch still sounded pretty great!\nThe Floating Tray The floating trays from Wahoo Living seem to look the most similar to what I\u0026rsquo;ve seen on social media, but I wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to purchase one directly from their website.\nI found the one I was looking for (from Wahoo Living) on Amazon.\nThey offered two colors at the time, white and brown. I initially intended to buy the white one, but it was out of stock and I was impatient\u0026hellip;so I just ordered the brown. I actually like it a lot and I\u0026rsquo;m glad I ended up with this color.\nThe DIY Floating Brunch My husband’s face looked both excited and horrified when I told him we were about to have brunch in our pool. His mind was racing with images of a flipped tray, broken dishes and food on the bottom of our brand new pool.\nThankfully, everything was very stable on the tray as it floated in the water.\nEven so, I was glad I used our lightweight break-resistant melamine plates and bowls for the food and unbreakable stemless wine glasses for our mimosas (and for when I have wine while relaxing in the bathtub, which I highly recommend).\nI love the classic look of white dishware and clear glass, so I was thrilled that I can achieve this look outdoors with no worries. The only exception is our coffee cups and saucers - I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find an unbreakable equivalent that I liked, so those are the real deal, and we were just real careful.\nThe DIY floating brunch was a (totally unnecessary but) really fun, romantic and memorable experience. The best part is that now we can enjoy it as often as we’d like!\nI think this tray is a \u0026lsquo;must-have\u0026rsquo; if you have a pool for obvious reasons, but even if you don\u0026rsquo;t, I actually think it\u0026rsquo;s a great overall investment for entertaining. You can line it and load it up with ice for a spacious and stylish cooler, lay down some parchment paper and serve charcuterie, or even breakfast in bed!\nFloating or not, I\u0026rsquo;m really happy with my DIY floating brunch and the many ways I can use this versital, well-made tray in the future!\nShop this post:           ","permalink":"https://dreacole.com/blog/floating-tray-brunch/","tags":["brunch","pool","Outdoor"],"title":"Bali-inspired DIY Floating Brunch"},{"categories":["Plants"],"contents":"I’ve never had much luck with plants\u0026hellip;\nBut our house has tons of natural light and a courtyard - yaasss! - so I was inspired to fill both with live plants and become the plant mom I’ve secretly always wanted to be.\nI tend to fully commit to things like this, but I still surprised myself (and my husband) when I bought something like 25 plants in 2 weeks. I started to notice what an impact they make and it was hard to stop.\nReal or fake, plants add visual interest, softness and color\u0026hellip;which works especially well in spaces with more of a modern aesthetic and neutral colors, like ours.\nSee for yourself in some before and after pics (where I only added plants)\u0026hellip;\nI buy my plants from various places\u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;Etsy, the garden department at Lowe’s and Home Depot, Plantvine, Bloomscape and even Amazon.\nBloomscape is a great option for when you want full sized plants that are ready for display upon arrival.

My husband cannot control himself around this guacamole and typically eats so much that he ends up (accidentally) making it a meal.\nI like to put a good amount of garlic and spice in almost everything I make; this recipe is no different. If that isn’t your thing, skip it altogether or just add less than what the recipe calls for.\nIngredients  5 large ripe avocados 2 or 3 green onions, diced ¼ cup red onions, diced (optional) 3 cloves garlic, minced ½ lime, juiced 2 serrano peppers (minced, one with seeds \u0026amp; one without) 1 large ripe tomato, diced (or) about 15 cherry tomatoes, quartered Small bunch of cilantro, chopped 1 tsp ground cumin ½ tsp garlic powder ½ - 1 tsp kosher salt (to taste) 1 tsp fresh ground black pepper  Preparation Um\u0026hellip;put all that %#@! in a bowl and stir it. ;) Just kidding….but not that much.\n Cut four of the avocados in half, discard the pits, scoop out the green goodness, chop into small pieces and put into a large bowl. Leave the fifth one alone for now; see tips. Add all other ingredients into the same bowl, and mix until well combined. Taste and adjust seasoning if needed. Let it sit for about 5 mins, then give it another good stir. Grab a spoon or some of your favorite tortilla chips and show that guac who the real boss is!  Tips  If you prefer a smoother texture - smash some or all of the avocado with a fork instead of chopping it. I personally like this with a little of both red and green onions. If you prefer, skip the green onion and sub ½ cup of diced red or white onion instead. The actual size of the avocados you use can affect how much salt, spice, lime, etc. is actually needed. If you’re unsure, start with half of the spice, salt, and lime quantities, then taste and add more if needed. If you happen to over-season, just add the 5th avocado. Give it a little sweetness by mixing in some fresh diced pineapple or mango instead of (or in addition to) the tomato. Spread on toast and top with a fried egg and/or some bacon; so delicious!

With the COVID pandemic, we also decided to tackle homeschooling full time.\nDuring the week, it\u0026rsquo;s not uncommon for both of us to already be on conference calls when our 6 year old son, Mason, wakes up (which is usually around 7am).\nIf he gets up and when we\u0026rsquo;re both on a call, breakfast has to wait until one of us can get it for him.\nI wanted to come up with something that allows him to get breakfast on his own and make it a little easier on all of us during those hectic mornings.

To close things out on a high note, we planned on going out for a nice al fresco brunch at a place that serves our favorite Bellini cocktails.\nPlans changed when the Big Joe modular sofa sets I ordered for our backyard arrived much sooner than expected\u0026hellip;like 3 weeks early\u0026hellip;.and I was too excited to wait until we got back from brunch to set it all up. Also, the delivery guy stacked all 11 boxes in front of our garage door, so we were blocked in anyway!\n(By the way, I love these couches so much - post coming soon).\nLong story short, we stayed home and enjoyed a homemade brunch with Bellinis on the new comfy couches in our backyard.\nA traditional Bellini is made with fresh or frozen peach puree. We didn’t have any peaches, but we did have a bottle of Simply Peach juice - hello shortcut!\nSome notes:  This recipe is for a batch (you’re welcome)\u0026hellip;I use a 1 liter juice carafe like this one. I used regular vodka this time, but you can make it with a peach-flavored or even vanilla-flavored vodka instead! I personally have tried it with the vanilla vodka and it was really tasty. I prefer a Brut (aka dry / not sweet) champagne or sparkling wine - the peach juice adds a good amount of sweetness. After you pour bellini, you can always add more juice to your glass if you like it sweeter. If you don’t have or like vodka, no worries! It’s still pretty great with just the bubbles and peach juice. Some of my go-to choices when making cocktails are Tott\u0026rsquo;s Brut Champagne (pictured), Alma Brut, and Veuve de Vernay. These are also pretty good for drinking on their own\u0026hellip;although for that my personal favorite is Veuve Clicquot Brut.

I ordered my first one at a Brazilian steakhouse and it instantly became my new favorite cocktail!\nIt’s already a very easy to make at home with only three ingredients - limes, sugar and Brazilian cachaça rum (made from fermented sugarcane juice)\u0026hellip;it\u0026rsquo;s so refreshing and so good.\nThe other day, I wanted to make a Caipirinha but we didn\u0026rsquo;t have any limes! That is when I discovered a shortcut that makes my favorite cocktail even easier to make, with only two ingredients.\nWhat makes this shortcut Caipirinha possible is actually margarita mix - Tres Agaves Organic Margarita Mix to be exact. In addition to making a delicous \u0026lsquo;shortcut\u0026rsquo; margarita, this one-step lime + agave mix is a tasty duplicate for the muddled lime + sugar in a Caipirinha. It\u0026rsquo;s also a real time saver if you want to make a party-sized batch of this delicious cocktail.\nSome notes  I found Tres Agaves Organic Margarita Mix at my local World Market, but it’s also available at liquor stores and places like Total Wine, Target, Walmart or in a pack of two on Amazon here. Cachaça rum is available at most liquor stores. I recommend starting with Pirassununga 51 Cachaça if you don’t already have a favorite brand. When we enjoy these outside (especially if we\u0026rsquo;re by the pool), I switch to using our unbreakable rocks glasses or unbreakable stemless wine glasses (with a little less ice). I love these because they\u0026rsquo;re safe for outdoors and have the look of real glass without the risk.  Okay, let\u0026rsquo;s do this!\nShortcut Caipirinha - serves 1  3 ounces Tres Agave margarita mix 2 ounces cachaça rum Optional garnish: lime wedge  Preparation - Pour the margarita mix and the rum into a rocks glass and stir well. Fill the glass to the rim with ice, stir again and garnish with lime wedge.\nShortcut batch Caipirinha - approximately 8 servings I’ve made a batch of ‘traditional’ Caipirinhas before and it was fairly time consuming to prep and juice and muddle all of the limes required. This margarita mix shortcut is a real time saver if you want to whip up a quick and tasty batch.\n 1 (Ltr) bottle Tres Agave margarita mix 2 1/2 cups cachaça rum Optional garnish: 8 lime wedges (from 2 limes)  Preparation - Pour the margarita mix and the rum into a large beverage container or pitcher and stir well. When ready to drink, pour into rocks glasses filled to the rim with ice, stir again and garnish with lime wedge.\nTraditional Caipirinha - serves 1 If you\u0026rsquo;ve never had a Caipirinha, make sure you try this! It\u0026rsquo;s strong and delicious.\n 1 lime (quartered) 2 to 2 1/2 teaspoons sugar (to taste) 2 ounces​ (1/4 cup) cachaça rum Optional garnish: lime wedge  Preparation - In a rocks glass, muddle the sugar with 3 lime wedges. Add the rum and stir to mix well. Fill the glass to the rim with ice, stir again and garnish with the remaining lime wedge.\nI hope you try and love these Caipirinha recipies as much as I do.\nShop this post:         ","permalink":"https://dreacole.com/blog/caipirinha/","tags":["Shortcut"],"title":"Shortcut Cocktail - The Caipirinha"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Your subscription to our list has been confirmed.\nThank you for subscribing!\n","permalink":"https://dreacole.com/contact/confirmed/","tags":null,"title":"Subscription Confirmed"}]
