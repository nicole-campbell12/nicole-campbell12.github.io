[{"categories":["Recipies"],"contents":"You need this sassy guacamole in your life.\nIt’s spicy with a little attitude and has just the right amount of texture. My husband cannot control himself when I make this and typically eats so much that he ends up accidentally making it a meal.\nI like to put a good amount of garlic and spice in almost everything I make, and this recipe is no different. If that isn’t your thing, skip it altogether or just add less than what the recipe calls for.\nIngredients  5 large ripe avocados 2 or 3 green onions, diced ¼ cup red onions, diced (optional) 3 cloves garlic, minced ½ lime, juiced 2 serrano peppers (minced, one with seeds \u0026amp; one without) 1 large ripe tomato, diced (or) about 15 cherry tomatoes, quartered Small bunch of cilantro, chopped 1 tsp ground cumin ½ tsp garlic powder ½ - 1 tsp kosher salt (to taste) 1 tsp fresh ground black pepper  Preparation Um\u0026hellip;put all that %#@! in a bowl and stir it. ;) Just kidding….but not that much.\n Cut four of the avocados in half, discard the pits, scoop out the green goodness, chop into small pieces and put into a large bowl. Leave the fifth one alone for now; see tips. Add all other ingredients into the same bowl, and mix until well combined. Taste and adjust seasoning if needed. Let it sit for about 5 mins, then give it another good stir. Grab a spoon or some of your favorite tortilla chips and show that guac who the real boss is!  Tips  If you prefer smoother guac - smash the avocado with a fork instead of chopping it. I like this with a little of both red and green onions. If you prefer, sub ½ cup of diced red or white onion instead. The actual size of the produce you use can affect how much salt, spice, lime, etc. is actually needed. If you’re unsure, start with half of the spice, salt, and lime quantities, then taste and add more if needed. If you happen to over-season, add another avocado. Give it a little sweetness by mixing in some fresh diced pineapple or mango instead of (or in addition to) the tomato. Spread on toast and top with a fried egg and/or some bacon; so delicious!

Nah.\nI was browsing on Houzz.com and came across Your Space Furniture, a custom furniture company. Their Orlando platform bed had a similar modern look with custom fabric choices and headboards up to 120”\u0026hellip;but the price was wayyyy less than the RH bed. Winning!\nThey had great reviews, so I decided to take a chance.\nCustomizing the Orlando bed was fun and easy. We went king sized, with low profile feet (in black) and an 84” tall headboard.\nThey quickly mailed out some fabric swatches. I chose a deep blue velvet called Mysteree Eclipse.\nOur bed was complete about 3 weeks later; I received pics of it from their shop.\nIt was then delivered and assembled by their “white glove” delivery service.\nThe experience with Your Space Furniture was excellent and I would definitely buy from them again (they also offer custom couches).\nLet me know what you think!\n","permalink":"https://dreacole.com/blog/custom-bed/","tags":["custom","bed","furniture"],"title":"Custom modern bed for less"},{"categories":["Plants"],"contents":"I’ve never had much luck with house plants\u0026hellip;\nBut our new home has a bright open floorplan AND a courtyard (yaasss!), so I was inspired to become the plant mom I’ve secretly always wanted to be.\nI tend to fully commit to things like this, but I still surprised myself (and my husband) when I bought something like 25 plants in 2 weeks. I started to notice what an impact they make and it was hard to stop.\nReal or fake, plants add visual interest, softness and color\u0026hellip;which works especially well in spaces with more of a modern aesthetic and neutral colors, like ours.\nSee for yourself in these before and after pics (where I only added plants)\u0026hellip;\nI shopped for plants in various places\u0026hellip;Etsy, Amazon, the garden department at Lowe’s and Home Depot, Plantvine and Bloomscape.\nBloomscape is very cool option for full sized plants that are ready for display upon arrival. You can get 20% off your purchase of $100 or more here{:target=\u0026rdquo;_blank\u0026rdquo;}\nPlantvine also has full sized plants\u0026hellip;but you don\u0026rsquo;t have to buy or add a planter pot, so there\u0026rsquo;s more flexibility in terms of total cost.\nI love the impact that plants make inside our home and I\u0026rsquo;m a total \u0026lsquo;Plant Mom\u0026rsquo; now!\nDrea Cole\n","permalink":"https://dreacole.com/blog/plants/","tags":["plants"],"title":"Decorating With Plants"},{"categories":["Outdoor"],"contents":"You may have seen them on social media\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;gorgeous photos of travelers enjoying a ‘floating brunch’ at a luxury resort in Bali or Thailand. This was on my mind as I looked at the newly completed pool in our backyard.\nWe have no plans for a trip to either of these destinations, but a private stay-cation style floating brunch still sounded pretty amazing!\nThe Tray I found a few floating tray options from Wahoo Living on Amazon.\nTheir smaller size is perfect for brunch for two. The white one was out of stock at the moment so I just ordered the brown one.\nThey also have a larger round size that would be pretty cool to use for floating snacks and drinks at a pool party!\nDIY Floating Brunch My husband’s face looked both excited and horrified when I told him we were about to have brunch in our pool. He said his mind was racing with images of a flipped tray, followed by broken dishes and food on the bottom of our brand new pool.\nThankfully, our meal was very stable on the tray in the water.\nEven so, I was glad I used these lightweight break-resistant melamine plates and bowls for the food and unbreakable stemless wine glasses for the mimosas. We use them a lot for general outside dining too.\nThe DIY floating brunch was a (totally unnecessary but) really fun, romantic and memorable experience. The best part is that you can enjoy it as often as you’d like! I also plan to load it up with snacks and have a little picnic in the grassy area of our backyard.\nComment below and let me know what you think!\nBest,\nDrea Cole\n","permalink":"https://dreacole.com/blog/floating-tray/","tags":["brunch","pool","tray"],"title":"DIY Bali-inspired Floating Brunch"},{"categories":["Design"],"contents":"House tour coming soon!

Self-serve breakfast options.\nFor cereal, I bought this dual dispenser and these squeeze bottles so that he doesn’t have a hard time (or make a huge mess) adding milk. We keep plastic bowls where he can reach and it’s very easy for him to make a bowl of cereal now.\nI also put some individual servings of greek yogurt in the lower part of our refrigerator and also make sure we have plenty of bananas. If they get too ripe, I use them to make muffins and put them in a container on the counter as another breakfast option.\nI might also try leaving some peeled hard boiled eggs in the refrigerator for him too.\nSo far, so good! He gets breakfast as soon as his eyes open (almost literally) and I get to stay in bed for a while longer.\nHe actually told me that making breakfast for himself is fun. I think it gives him that independent ‘big boy’ feeling, so it’s a win-win for us!\nFor what it’s worth\u0026hellip;our bedroom door is open so that I can hear him in the kitchen, so I’m not actually able to ‘sleep sleep’ but it’s still nice to lay in bed and get some much needed rest!\nSources:\nSqueeze bottles\nCereal dispenser\nMelamine bowls (these are also great for outdoor / poolside dining)\nWire fruit basket\n","permalink":"https://dreacole.com/blog/kid-breakfast/","tags":["kids","food","breakfast"],"title":"Self-Serve Kids Breakfast"},{"categories":["Cocktails"],"contents":"If you haven\u0026rsquo;t already experienced the sweet bliss of a Caipirinha (heeeeey kai-purr-reen-yah \u0026lsquo;aight), I highly recommend it. I ordered my first one at a Brazilian steakhouse and it instantly became my new go-to cocktail!\nIt’s already a very easy to make at home with only three ingredients - limes, sugar and Brazilian cachaça rum (made from fermented sugarcane juice)\u0026hellip;so refreshing and so good.\nThe other day, I found myself without any limes\u0026hellip;terrible right!?! Anyway, it turned out to be a good thing because I discovered a shortcut that makes my favorite cocktail even easier to make with only two ingredients.\nWhat makes this shortcut Caipirinha possible is actually margarita mix - Tres Agaves Organic Margarita Mix to be exact. In addition to making a delicous \u0026lsquo;shortcut\u0026rsquo; margarita, this one-step lime + agave mix is a tasty duplicate for the multi-step muddled lime + sugar in a Caipirinha. It\u0026rsquo;s also a real time saver if you ever want to make a batch of this delicious cocktail.\nSome notes  I found Tres Agaves Organic Margarita Mix at my local World Market, but it’s also available at liquor stores and places like Total Wine, Target, Walmart and of course, Amazon. Cachaça rum is available at most liquor stores. I recommend starting with Pirassununga 51 Cachaça if you don’t already have a favorite brand. Sometimes I make these in stemless red wine glasses (with a little less ice) instead of a rocks glass.  Okay, let\u0026rsquo;s do this!\nShortcut Caipirinha - serves 1  3 ounces Tres Agave margarita mix 2 ounces cachaça rum Optional garnish: lime wedge  Preparation - Pour the margarita mix and the rum into a rocks glass and stir well. Fill the glass to the rim with ice, stir again and garnish with lime wedge.\nShortcut batch Caipirinha - serves 8 I’ve made a batch of ‘traditional’ Caipirinhas before and it was a little bit of a lime-related struggle. This margarita mix shortcut is a real time saver if you ever want to whip up a quick batch.\n 1 (Ltr) bottle Tres Agave margarita mix 2 1/2 cups cachaça rum Optional garnish: 8 lime wedges (from 2 limes)  Preparation - Pour the margarita mix and the rum into a large beverage container or pitcher and stir well. When ready to drink, pour into rocks glasses filled to the rim with ice, stir again and garnish with lime wedge.\nTraditional Caipirinha - serves 1 Here is a more ‘proper’ Caipirinha recipe that you should consider making at any point in time.\n 1 lime (quartered) 2 to 2 1/2 teaspoons sugar (to taste) 2 ounces​ (1/4 cup) cachaça rum Optional garnish: lime wedge  Preparation - In a rocks glass, muddle the sugar with 3 lime wedges. Add the rum and stir to mix well. Fill the glass to the rim with ice, stir again and garnish with the remaining lime wedge.\nI hope you try and love these Caipirinha recipies as much as I do.
