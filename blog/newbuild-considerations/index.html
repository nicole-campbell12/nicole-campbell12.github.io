        <div class="content mb-5">
          <p>There are many decisions to make when building a new construction home, before <em>and</em> after you move in.  I wanted to share some less common considerations and related upgrades that we made while designing, building and getting settled in our new home.</p>
<h4 id="1-future-proof-cabinets">1. Future-Proof Cabinets</h4>
<p>There are some cabinet materials that can’t or shouldn’t be painted, like vinyl, laminate, and engineered wood for example.  If your preferred cabinet color requires an undesirable upgrade and you plan to ‘get the look’ with paint instead, be sure to choose a compatible material when selecting your cabinets from the design center.</p>
<h4 id="2-natural-lighting-changes">2. Natural Lighting Changes</h4>
<p>Our owner’s bedroom and bathroom gets tons of natural light from the windows facing the empty lot next door. Initially I thought our bathroom was so bright that it could handle some dark and moody shades, but then I realized how much light we’ll probably lose once that lot has a two-story house it.</p>
<p>I decided to keep our temporary blinds up until I can really see how our view, privacy and lighting will be affected once the construction next door is completed.</p>
<h4 id="3-shower-niche-placement">3. Shower Niche Placement</h4>
<p>We wanted to keep soaps, shampoos and other shower products out of sight, so we asked for the niche to be built in a way that is not visible unless you’re actually taking a shower. I’m so happy we did this - it gives us a clean and tidy look from the outside, even though that’s usually not the case on the inside.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/post/hidden-niche.png" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="4-custom-closet-prep">4. Custom Closet Prep</h4>
<p>We planned on building &lsquo;custom&rsquo; (Ikea Pax) closets in our owner&rsquo;s suite immediately after moving in. We asked the builder not to finish out that closet with clothing racks so that we didn’t have to remove them before we could install the custom stuff.</p>
<h4 id="5-drop-in-vs-freestanding-bathtub">5. Drop-in vs Freestanding Bathtub</h4>
<p>Our owner’s suite included a drop-in tub, which is when the tub is surrounded and enclosed in tile, usually in a corner of the bathroom. We upgraded to the builder’s single (likey overpriced) option for a freestanding bathtub.</p>
<p>Overall I&rsquo;m happy with the design choice, but I realize now that another option might have been for them to skip the buildout altogether and just do the plumbing work for a freestanding tub that we purchased ourselves and installed after closing. This would have broadened our design choices and saved us a few thousand bucks.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/post/freestanding-tub.png" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="6-watertoilet-closet-upgrade">6. Water/Toilet Closet &ldquo;Upgrade&rdquo;</h4>
<p>We asked for an uncommon (and very inexpensive) upgrade - adding an electrical outlet to the ‘water closet’ in the owner’s suite bathroom, so that we could plug in a night-light. Now we don’t have to turn on the light for those middle-of-the-night trips to the bathroom!</p>
<h4 id="7-media-room-with-a-view">7. (Media) Room with a View</h4>
<p>Our builder provided the option to upgrade to a traditional media room, which is essentially a room with no windows. Instead, we chose to add their ‘bonus room’ option. It&rsquo;s in the same location, but has four windows along the back wall. We still set it up as a media room.</p>
<p>When the room isn’t being used for movie-watching, we can leave the doors open to enjoy the second-story view and natural light in the room. When it’s time to watch a show, our floor-to-ceiling blackout curtains do the trick. This gives us more of a multi-purpose or &lsquo;flex&rsquo; room, which is also a nice differentiator for furutre re-sale.</p>
<h4 id="8-pre-treated-grout">8. Pre-treated Grout</h4>
<p>We paid a very small amount to upgrade to pre-treated grout, which is more resistant to stains, mold and mildew. I paid way more to have the grout professionally sealed in our previous home&hellip;they did a terrible job, and I ended up going back over what they did by hand. I was very happy to skip this step and still get the extra protection.</p>
<h4 id="9-carpet-pad-regrets">9. Carpet Pad Regrets</h4>
<p>This is another fairly inexpensive upgrade, and one that we actually forgot to do. Our upstairs is carpeted and the standard pad they used is pretty thin. When we&rsquo;re walking around, we notice and regret it&hellip;especially since we went through the trouble of upgrading the carpet itself. Lesson learned.</p>
<h4 id="10-white-ceilings-are-an-upgrade">10. White Ceilings are an Upgrade</h4>
<p>I was surprised to learn that it is standard for most new home builders to paint the ceilings the same color you choose for your walls. Unless you pick white for your walls, this could become a major design issue for you. This one might be a little more common knowledge, but I wanted to mention it anyway because it&rsquo;s definately something you don&rsquo;t want to realize after-the-fact.</p>
<p>Even though our wall color is very light gray, we still opted to upgrade to white ceilings to keep things light and bright&hellip;and in case we ever want to go with a darker wall color in the future. You can also skip the upgrade cost by choosing &lsquo;builder&rsquo;s white&rsquo; paint everywhere, and then paint the walls in a different color room-by-room over time.</p>
